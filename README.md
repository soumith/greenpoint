The hipster version of SSH + X11 forwarding

* Browser-based frontend + Node.js backend
* Persistent shell (putting laptop into sleep mode or a bad cell-phone connection is okay!)
* Websockets support!
* Windowing+Audio API for pushing image streams and audio streams (images, videos, audio)
   * HTML/javascript window templates to quickly extend to high-level graphing/charting using D3 etc.
* Sensor API to get access to the webcam, microphone on client
* Authentication using username/password or your Google/Facebook/Twitter/OAuth. Supports all Passport.js middleware.
* Command-line utility to quickly open images, videos, audio
* Torch-7 package to use the windowing capabilities (images, video, audio, webcam, microphone)
* Notebook sessions, to quickly render interleaved markdown (with Latex support) + shell output and save it for later viewing.
